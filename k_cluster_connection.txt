Connecting to the K-cluster.

Connecting to the K-cluster via the terminal is as simple as (the -p is required for RSA authentication):

    ssh -p 222 <username>@K. larc.nasa.gov

You will then be prompted to enter your password, this will be your RSA token (careful, too many incorrect guesses will get you locked out and then you will have to call the ESD).

The only catch is that every time you want to connect to the K-cluster, you will need to input your RSA token.
To bypass this, a key can be generated and transferred over to the K-cluster to avoid having to input an RSA token every time.
The first step is to generate an RSA ssh key (this should be run locally from the terminal on your mac):

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -0 -a 100

When creating your key, it will ask you for information such as the name, you can just press enter to skip each of these steps.
Next, you will want to transfer the key over to the K-cluster so it is recognized (will require your RSA token once):

    ssh-copy-id -p 222 <username>@K. larc.nasa.gov

The final step is to add the following using `vim ~/.ssh/config`:

    Host k
        HostName K.larc.nasa.gov
        User <username>

Now, you can simply type `ssh k` and you will be connected to the K-cluster without a password!
Careful though, do not add `Port 222` to the `~/.ssh/config` or else it will make you enter your password every time.
Let me know if you have any questions!
