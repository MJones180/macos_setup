CONNECTING TO A REMOTE SERVER
-----------------------------

Connecting to a remote server in the terminal is as simple as:

    ssh <username>@<hostname>

You will then be prompted to enter your password.

The only catch is that you will be prompted for your password every time you remote in.

To bypass this, a key can be generated and transferred over to the remote server to avoid having to input your password everytime.
All commands below should be run locally on your mac:

1. Navigate to your `ssh` folder:

    cd ~/.ssh

2. Generate an RSA SSH key (run locally from terminal on your mac):

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -a 100

    Choose a filename that will identify what this key will be used for, this will be referred to as <filename>.

3. Transfer the key over to the remote server:

    ssh-copy-id -i <filename> <username>@<hostname>

4. Add the following lines to the `config` (~/.ssh/config):

    Host <connection_name>
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<filename>
        HostName <hostname>
        User <username>

5. You are able to SSh in easily now!

    ssh <connection_name>
