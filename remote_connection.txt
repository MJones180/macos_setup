CONNECTING TO A REMOTE SERVER
-----------------------------

Connecting to a remote server in the terminal is as simple as:

    ssh <username>@<domain/ip>

You will then be prompted to enter your password.
The only catch is that you will be prompted for your password every time you remote in.
To bypass this, a key can be generated and transferred over to the remote server to avoid having to input your password everytime.
The first step is to generate an rsa ssh key (this needs to be run locally from the terminal on your mac):

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -a 100

When creating your key, it will ask you for information such as the name, you can just press enter to skip each of these steps.
Next, you will want to transfer the key over to the remote server so it is recognized (will require your password once):

    ssh-copy-id <username>@<domain/ip>

The final step is to add the following using `vim ~/.ssh/config`:

    Host <connection_name>
        HostName <domain/ip>
        User <username>

Now, you can simply type `ssh <connection_name>` and you will be connected to the remote server without a password!
